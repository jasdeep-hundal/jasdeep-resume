   Worked on small team on Android middleware that will realize the full potential of next-generation MEMS sensors in mobile environments. Projects included debugging and writing a new API for a broken 3rd-party calibration library, writing a specialized data collection layer according to customer requirements, creating Android applications for sensor testing, and designing and implementing a threaded sensor HAL to enable sensor fusion for Android. Work shipped directly to STMicroelectronics customers for use on their chipsets.
